## üéì Emotional Purpose

**Easy English Numbers** is a learning sanctuary designed for autistic users who benefit from a calmer, more predictable sensory environment.

It offers:
- Visual and auditory repetition to reinforce engagement and retention  
- Quiz-based learning with gentle feedback and no stress triggers  
- A soothing interface that encourages exploration without pressure  

Future editions may include licensing modules for deployment in autistic centres and schools. These are preserved but dormant presently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Ritual & Recovery Guidance

During first compile or when opening Form Designer, you may encounter the following error:

> **Error**: A numeric comparison was attempted on `$(MsBuildMajorVersion)` that evaluates to `""` instead of a number, in condition `($(MsBuildMajorVersion) < 16)`.

This occurs when required packages are not yet restored‚Äîespecially after a fresh clone or migration. To resolve:

- If prompted, click **No** to continue, then go to **Build ‚Üí Rebuild Solution**  
- Alternatively, **Compile once**, then **Close and reopen Visual Studio**, and proceed to **Form Designer View**

This is a known ritual misstep and does not affect the emotional integrity of the application. Once resolved, all will be as it should be.
